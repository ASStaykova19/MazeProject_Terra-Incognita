 ## üí° Main idea of the project <a name = "idea"></a>
 
The idea of the project is to make a maze game. We used C++ as main language. <br>
We made a maze, generated by length and width, given by the user.<br>
There is also "How to play" screen, which showes the rules and more instructions.<br>
In the maze, there are collectables, which give you extra points.<br>
When you finish the maze, the program will congratulate you on winning and ask you if you want to continue playing.<br>
